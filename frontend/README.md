## 🚀 How it Works

1. Player logs in with **MonadGames ID**.  
2. They can play the game → scores sync to leaderboard via backend.  
3. Visiting the **NFT Shop** automatically switches connection:
   - Disconnects MonadGames ID
   - Prompts for injected wallet (MetaMask)
   - Ensures wallet is on **Monad Testnet**
4. NFT minting charges fees in Monad Testnet tokens.s  
5. Leaving the shop switches back to MonadGames ID seamlessly.
